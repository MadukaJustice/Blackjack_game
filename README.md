## some of the technologies and architecture that can be used to develop a blackjack game:
### Technology
#### *Programming language: The game was developed using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.
*Game engine: A game engine was used to simplify the development process by providing a framework for graphics, sound, and input handling.
*Art assets: The game needed art assets, such as cards, tables, and dealers. These assets was downloaded  from a third-party asset store.

## Limitation
## Regulation: The game may also be subject to regulation by gambling authorities. This can restrict the features and gameplay of this game.

## Licencing
#### If the game is intended to be released commercially, I may need to obtain a license from a gambling authority.
